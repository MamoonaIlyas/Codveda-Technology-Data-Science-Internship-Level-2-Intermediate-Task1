 Task 1: Predictive Modeling  (Regression)
 
📊 Task 1 – House Price Prediction using Regression Models
Internship Level: Intermediate
Organization: CodVeda Technology
Domain: Data Science / Machine Learning

This project involves building and evaluating multiple regression models to predict housing prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. The task is part of my Intermediate Level Data Science Internship with CodVeda Technology.

The goal is to understand how different machine learning models perform on a real-world dataset after applying standard preprocessing steps, and to compare their prediction accuracy using evaluation metrics.

🔍 Key Steps in the Project:
Loading and exploring the Boston Housing dataset

Handling outliers using the IQR method

Encoding categorical features (Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding)

Standardizing numerical variables using StandardScaler

Splitting the data into training and test sets

Training and evaluating the following regression models:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Comparing model performance using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (R²) Score

Visualizing the results (e.g., actual vs. predicted prices for linear regression)

✅ Outcome:
The Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance in terms of both MSE and R², demonstrating its strength in handling complex data patterns.
